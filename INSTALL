INSTALLATION OF THE COMMANDLINE INTERFACE
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this directory, type:

  ./configure CXXFLAGS="-Wall -O3"
  make

In case you want to debug, or are interested in gdb's or valgrind's output,
use:

  ./configure CXXFLAGS="-Wall -g -DSCA_DEBUG"


If you need more information about how to configure, type

  ./configure --help.

INSTALLATION OF THE QT GUI
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

For technical reasons, the GUI must be built separately. From this directory,
do these steps:

  cd src/gui
  qmake  # on your system, this might be qmake-qt4 or similar
  make
