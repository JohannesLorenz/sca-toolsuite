This file contains questions often asked by others.
Or questions I think others might ask.

Q: Is there no other COPYING restriction than GPL3?
A: Yes. This code was made by me in my free time, and I did not copy any line
   of code from other projects. This code was not written for any institution.

Q: I miss the ternary operator in the equation solver...
A: It might be comfortable, but I think you can always find a solution without
   using it. The reason I did not integrate it was not to overcomplicate the
   source code.

Q: I need --help as a filename...
A: Try to pass ./--help to the program.

Q: Is there a project file for my code editor?
A: If you are using qt creator: Yes. Use src/sca-toolsuite.pro.

Q: Is Qt necessary?
A: No, the .pro file is only for people who use qt creator for coding. The
   Makefile generation is done by autotools.
