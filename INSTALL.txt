0 Requirements
::::::::::::::

You will need the following libraries, headers and tools:

  C++ 4.8 or higher
  boost
  cmake
  Qt (if you want to build the GUI)

1 Installation of the commandline interface
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this directory, type:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. # TODO: define SCA_DEBUG, -Wall, -g

###
previous versions:

In this directory, type:

  ./configure CXXFLAGS="-Wall -O3"
  make

In case you want to debug, or are interested in gdb's or valgrind's output,
use:

  ./configure CXXFLAGS="-Wall -g -DSCA_DEBUG"

If you need more information about how to configure, type

  ./configure --help.

2 Installation of the Qt GUI
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

For technical reasons, the GUI must be built separately. From this directory,
do these steps:

  cd src/gui
  qmake  # on your system, this might be qmake-qt4 or similar
  make

3 Debugging
:::::::::::

The sca toosuite gives you debug output exactly if both of the following
conditions apply:

  1. you compiled with -DSCA_DEBUG (see (1) of this file)
  2. you set SCA_DEBUG=1 (or any other integer) in your shell

For the second condition, you can do either

  * SCA_DEBUG=1 ./path/program
  * export SCA_DEBUG=1; ./path/program

Debug output is always sent to stdout, so it does not affect pipelining.
